
# Emissions Comparison Widget (ECW)

An interactive visualisation tool for comparing emissions. This is a public API that people can embed into their websites.

# Hosting

Embeddable code is hosted on a subdomain of realworldvisuals.com with release versions published in separate folders. This enables us to release future versions without breaking sites that implement an older version. 

- ecw.realworldvisuals.com/v1/
- ecw.realworldvisuals.com/v2/
